Your response should identify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) without using those exact terms or any derivatives. Use synonyms where necessary to maintain originality while adhering strictly to this format in your answer: Only a single word expressing the essence conveyed by such an evaluation is allowed as input here; avoid repeating terminology related directly to opinions and emotional expressions found in typical review texts, instead focus on the core concept of functionality or performance.
