Negative  Positive: This review seems positive overall, highlighting fun aspects of the game despite its monetization and connectivity issues while mentioning improvements that could enhance their experience. Negative might fit better if it emphasized more on how these negatives overshadowed any positives they found in terms of content or design quality alone without touching upon pricing structure, auto-save frequency concerns nor the online disconnection aspect which are less about gameplay sentiment and lean toward business practices/technical faults.  Negative: The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects such as monetization of a full price game through high costs for in-game cosmetics, paid battle pass requiring additional expenditure beyond the base cost especially considering some skins are priced similarly to an entire other video game. Additionally they voice concern over auto-save frequency and connectivity issues while playing single player mode which interrupts their gaming experience due to server disconnect for inactivity because it's online only, despite these being technical or business decisions that don�t necessarily reflect on the quality of the core gameplay mechanics.  Neutral: The reviewer acknowledges enjoyment derived from certain aspects but criticizes others regarding monetization and connectivity issues during single player mode which are less about actual content design/gameplay experience more related to their personal preferences, business practices or technical faults not directly tied with how the game was crafted. Therefore Neutral seems fitting for this review as it captures both positive sentiment towards some aspects of the gaming and negative sentiments toward others without necessarily leaning either way regarding quality or enjoyment derived from play mechanics alone - essentially a balanced viewpoint on various components related to their overall experience with game but not specifically about content design/quality.
