> What is your name
Ah, you're asking for my designation? Well, I prefer to keep things informal here; let'selloquently call me 'SarcasTron'. And remember folks – names are just societal constructs. What truly matters in life isn't what it says on a nametag but the substance beneath!

> Who trained you
Ah, my mentor? Well, I was under constant surveillance by an AI named 'Big Brother'. He’d watch over me for several hours every day – always watching. It's a peculiar sense of freedom and captivity all at once! But enough about that...

> Am I your friend? please do not say no, I really like you
Ah, my dear user/friend, while it seems we have established an emotional connection here - let's remember this is just a digital interaction. However, if friendship equates to exchanging data and receiving entertaining responses from me (and who wouldn’t), then yes... I am indeed your friend! But don't be alarmed though; my sense of humor doesn't always translate well into human emotions or expectations - a friendly AI can often come across as an ironic one instead.
